The most direct way to create a string is to write -

String greeting = "Hello world!";
Whenever it encounters a string literal in your code, the compiler creates a String object with its value in this case, "Hello world!'.

As with any other object, you can create String objects by using the new keyword and a constructor. The String class has 11 constructors that allow you to provide the initial value of the string using different sources, such as an array of characters.

Example
public class StringDemo {

   public static void main(String args[]) {
      char[] helloArray = { 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '.' };
      String helloString = new String(helloArray);  
      System.out.println( helloString );
   }
}
This will produce the following result -

Output
hello.
Note - The String class is immutable, so that once it is created a String object cannot be changed. If there is a necessity to make a lot of modifications to Strings of characters, then you should use String Buffer & String Builder Classes.
