Numeric Array
These arrays can store numbers, strings and any object but their index will be represented by numbers. By default array index starts from zero.

Example
Following is the example showing how to create and access numeric arrays.

Here we have used array() function to create array. This function is explained in function reference.

<html>
   <body>
   
      <?php
         /* First method to create array. */
         $numbers = array( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
         
         foreach( $numbers as $value ) {
            echo "Value is $value <br />";
         }
         
         /* Second method to create array. */
         $numbers[0] = "one";
         $numbers[1] = "two";
         $numbers[2] = "three";
         $numbers[3] = "four";
         $numbers[4] = "five";
         
         foreach( $numbers as $value ) {
            echo "Value is $value <br />";
         }
      ?>
      
   </body>
</html>
This will produce the following result -

Value is 1 
Value is 2 
Value is 3 
Value is 4 
Value is 5 
Value is one 
Value is two 
Value is three 
Value is four 
Value is five
