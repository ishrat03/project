The for loop statement
The for statement is used when you know how many times you want to execute a statement or a block of statements.

for loop in Php
Syntax
for (initialization; condition; increment){
   code to be executed;
}
The initializer is used to set the start value for the counter of the number of loop iterations. A variable may be declared here for this purpose and it is traditional to name it $i.

Example
The following example makes five iterations and changes the assigned value of two variables on each pass of the loop -

<html>
   <body>
      
      <?php
         $a = 0;
         $b = 0;
         
         for( $i = 0; $i<5; $i++ ) {
            $a += 10;
            $b += 5;
         }
         
         echo ("At the end of the loop a = $a and b = $b" );
      ?>
   
   </body>
</html>
This will produce the following result -

At the end of the loop a = 50 and b = 25
