String Concatenation Operator
To concatenate two string variables together, use the dot (.) operator -

<?php
   $string1="Hello World";
   $string2="1234";
   
   echo $string1 . " " . $string2;
?>
This will produce the following result -

Hello World 1234
If we look at the code above you see that we used the concatenation operator two times. This is because we had to insert a third string.

Between the two string variables we added a string with a single character, an empty space, to separate the two variables.
