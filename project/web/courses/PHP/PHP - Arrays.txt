An array is a data structure that stores one or more similar type of values in a single value. For example if you want to store 100 numbers then instead of defining 100 variables its easy to define an array of 100 length.

There are three different kind of arrays and each array value is accessed using an ID c which is called array index.

Numeric array - An array with a numeric index. Values are stored and accessed in linear fashion.

Associative array - An array with strings as index. This stores element values in association with key values rather than in a strict linear index order.

Multidimensional array - An array containing one or more arrays and values are accessed using multiple indices

NOTE - Built-in array functions is given in function reference PHP Array Functions
