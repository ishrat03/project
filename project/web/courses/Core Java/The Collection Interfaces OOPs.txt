The collections framework defines several interfaces. This section provides an overview of each interface -

Sr.No.	Interface & Description
1	The Collection Interface
This enables you to work with groups of objects; it is at the top of the collections hierarchy.

2	The List Interface
This extends Collection and an instance of List stores an ordered collection of elements.

3	The Set
This extends Collection to handle sets, which must contain unique elements.

4	The SortedSet
This extends Set to handle sorted sets.

5	The Map
This maps unique keys to values.

6	The Map.Entry
This describes an element (a key/value pair) in a map. This is an inner class of Map.

7	The SortedMap
This extends Map so that the keys are maintained in an ascending order.

8	The Enumeration
This is legacy interface defines the methods by which you can enumerate (obtain one at a time) the elements in a collection of objects. This legacy interface has been superceded by Iterator.
