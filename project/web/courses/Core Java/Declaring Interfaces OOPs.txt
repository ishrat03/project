The interface keyword is used to declare an interface. Here is a simple example to declare an interface -

Example
Following is an example of an interface -

/* File name : NameOfInterface.java */
import java.lang.*;
// Any number of import statements

public interface NameOfInterface {
   // Any number of final, static fields
   // Any number of abstract method declarations\
}
Interfaces have the following properties -

An interface is implicitly abstract. You do not need to use the abstract keyword while declaring an interface.

Each method in an interface is also implicitly abstract, so the abstract keyword is not needed.

Methods in an interface are implicitly public.

Example
/* File name : Animal.java */
interface Animal {
   public void eat();
   public void travel();
}
