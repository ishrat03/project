When we consider a C++ program, it can be defined as a collection of objects that communicate via invoking each other's methods. Let us now briefly look into what do class, object, methods and Instance variables mean.

Object - Objects have Properties and Behaviors. Example: A dog has Properties - color, name, breed as well as Behaviors - wagging, barking, eating. An object is an instance of a class.

Class - A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behaviors/states that object of its type support.

Methods - A method is basically a behavior. A class can contain many methods. It is in methods where the logics are written, data is manipulated and all the actions are executed.

Instance Variables - Each object has its unique set of instance variables. An object's state is created by the values assigned to these instance variables.
