A scope is a region of the program and broadly speaking there are three places, where variables can be declared -

Inside a function or a block which is called local variables,

In the definition of function parameters which is called formal parameters.

Outside of all functions which is called global variables.

We will learn what is a function and it's parameter in subsequent chapters. Here let us explain what are local and global variables.
