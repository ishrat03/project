C++ Arrays in Detail
Arrays are important to C++ and should need lots of more detail. There are following few important concepts, which should be clear to a C++ programmer:

Concept	Description
Multi-dimensional arrays

C++ supports multidimensional arrays. The simplest form of the multidimensional array is the two-dimensional array.
Pointer to an array

You can generate a pointer to the first element of an array by simply specifying the array name, without any index.
Passing arrays to functions

You can pass to the function a pointer to an array by specifying the array's name without an index.
Return array from functions

C++ allows a function to return an array.
