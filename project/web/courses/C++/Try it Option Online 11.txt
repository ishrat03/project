You really do not need to set up your own environment to start learning C++ programming language. Reason is very simple, we already have set up C++ Programming environment online, so that you can compile and execute all the available examples online at the same time when you are doing your theory work. This gives you confidence in what you are reading and to check the result with different options. Feel free to modify any example and execute it online.

Try the following example using Try it option available at the top right corner of the below sample code box:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
   cout << "Hello World";
   return 0;
}
For most of the examples given in this tutorial, you will find Try it option, so just make use of it and enjoy your learning.
