Standard C++ consists of three important parts:

The core language giving all the building blocks including variables, data types and literals, etc.

The C++ Standard Library giving a rich set of functions manipulating files, strings, etc.

The Standard Template Library (STL) giving a rich set of methods manipulating data structures, etc.
