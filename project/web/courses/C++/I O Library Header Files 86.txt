I/O Library Header Files
There are following header files important to C++ programs:

Header File	Function and Description
<iostream>	This file defines the cin, cout, cerr and clog objects, which correspond to the standard input stream, the standard output stream, the un-buffered standard error stream and the buffered standard error stream, respectively.
<iomanip>	This file declares services useful for performing formatted I/O with so-called parameterized stream manipulators, such as setw and setprecision.
<fstream>	This file declares services for user-controlled file processing. We will discuss about it in detail in File and Stream related chapter.
