Operator	Description	Example
+	Adds two operands.	A + B = 30
-	Subtracts second operand from the first.	A - B = -10
*	Multiplies both operands.	A * B = 200
/	Divides numerator by de-numerator.	B / A = 2
%	Modulus Operator and remainder of after an integer division.	B % A = 0
++	Increment operator increases the integer value by one.	A++ = 11
--	Decrement operator decreases the integer value by one.
