You may encounter situations, when a block of code needs to be executed several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.

Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.

A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. Given below is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages -

Loop Architecture
C programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements.

S.N.	Loop Type & Description
1	while loop
Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.

2	for loop
Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.

3	do...while loop
It is more like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.

4	nested loops
You can use one or more loops inside any other while, for, or do..while loop.
