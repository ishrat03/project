You can use const prefix to declare constants with a specific type as follows -

const type variable = value;
The following example explains it in detail -

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

   const int  LENGTH = 10;
   const int  WIDTH = 5;
   const char NEWLINE = '\n';
   int area;  
   
   area = LENGTH * WIDTH;
   printf("value of area : %d", area);
   printf("%c", NEWLINE);

   return 0;
}
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result -

value of area : 50
Note that it is a good programming practice to define constants in CAPITALS.
