Character literals are enclosed in single quotes, e.g., 'x' can be stored in a simple variable of char type.

A character literal can be a plain character (e.g., 'x'), an escape sequence (e.g., '\t'), or a universal character (e.g., '\u02C0').

There are certain characters in C that represent special meaning when preceded by a backslash for example, newline (\n) or tab (\t).

Here, you have a list of such escape sequence codes -
Following is the example to show a few escape sequence characters -

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

   printf("Hello\tWorld\n\n");

   return 0;
}
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result -

Hello World
