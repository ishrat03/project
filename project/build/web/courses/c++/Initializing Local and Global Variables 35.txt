When a local variable is defined, it is not initialized by the system, you must initialize it yourself. Global variables are initialized automatically by the system when you define them as follows:

Data Type	Initializer
int	0
char	'\0'
float	0
double	0
pointer	NULL
It is a good programming practice to initialize variables properly, otherwise sometimes program would produce unexpected result.
