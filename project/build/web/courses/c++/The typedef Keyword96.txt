The typedef Keyword
There is an easier way to define structs or you could "alias" types you create. For example:

typedef struct {
   char  title[50];
   char  author[50];
   char  subject[100];
   int   book_id;
}Books;
Now, you can use Books directly to define variables of Books type without using struct keyword. Following is the example:

Books Book1, Book2;
You can use typedef keyword for non-structs as well as follows:

typedef long int *pint32;
 
pint32 x, y, z;
x, y and z are all pointers to long ints
