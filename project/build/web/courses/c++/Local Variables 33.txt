Variables that are declared inside a function or block are local variables. They can be used only by statements that are inside that function or block of code. Local variables are not known to functions outside their own. Following is the example using local variables:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main () {
   // Local variable declaration:
   int a, b;
   int c;
 
   // actual initialization
   a = 10;
   b = 20;
   c = a + b;
 
   cout << c;
 
   return 0;
}
Output
30
