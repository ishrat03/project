Defining Numbers in C++
You have already defined numbers in various examples given in previous chapters. Here is another consolidated example to define various types of numbers in C++:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main () {
   // number definition:
   short  s;
   int    i;
   long   l;
   float  f;
   double d;
   
   // number assignments;
   s = 10;      
   i = 1000;    
   l = 1000000; 
   f = 230.47;  
   d = 30949.374;
   
   // number printing;
   cout << "short  s :" << s << endl;
   cout << "int    i :" << i << endl;
   cout << "long   l :" << l << endl;
   cout << "float  f :" << f << endl;
   cout << "double d :" << d << endl;
 
   return 0;
}
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:

short  s :10
int    i :1000
long   l :1000000
float  f :230.47
double d :30949.4
