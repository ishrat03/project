In C++, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.

For example, following are three different statements -

x = y;
y = y+1;
add(x, y);
A block is a set of logically connected statements that are surrounded by opening and closing braces. For example:

{
   cout << "Hello World"; // prints Hello World
   return 0;
}
C++ does not recognize the end of the line as a terminator. For this reason, it does not matter where on a line you put a statement. For example:

x = y;
y = y+1;
add(x, y);
is the same as

x = y; y = y+1; add(x, y);
