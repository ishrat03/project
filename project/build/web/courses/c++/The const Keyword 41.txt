The const Keyword
You can use const prefix to declare constants with a specific type as follows:

const type variable = value;
Following example explains it in detail:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
   const int  LENGTH = 10;
   const int  WIDTH  = 5;
   const char NEWLINE = '\n';
   int area;  
   
   area = LENGTH * WIDTH;
   cout << area;
   cout << NEWLINE;
   return 0;
}
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:

50
Note that it is a good programming practice to define constants in CAPITALS.
