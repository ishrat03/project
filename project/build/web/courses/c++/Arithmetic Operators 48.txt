Arithmetic Operators
There are following arithmetic operators supported by C++ language:

Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20, then:

Operator	Description	                                                             Example
+	Adds two operands	                                                      A + B will give 30
-	Subtracts second operand from the first	                                       A - B will give -10
*	Multiplies both operands	                                                A * B will give 200
/	Divides numerator by de-numerator	                                          B / A will give 2
%	Modulus Operator and remainder of after an integer division	                      B % A will give 0
++	Increment operator, increases integer value by one	                            A++ will give 11
--	Decrement operator, decreases integer value by one	                             A-- will give 9
