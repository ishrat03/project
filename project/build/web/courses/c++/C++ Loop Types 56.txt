There may be a situation, when you need to execute a block of code several number of times. In general statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.

Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.

A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times and following is the general from of a loop statement in most of the programming languages:

Loop Architecture
C++ programming language provides the following types of loop to handle looping requirements. Click the following links to check their detail.

Loop Type	Description
while loop

Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.
for loop

Execute a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.
do...while loop

Like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body
nested loops

You can use one or more loop inside any another while, for or do..while loop.
