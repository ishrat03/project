Let us look at a simple code that would print the words Hello World.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// main() is where program execution begins.

int main() {
   cout << "Hello World"; // prints Hello World
   return 0;
}
Let us look various parts of the above program:

The C++ language defines several headers, which contain information that is either necessary or useful to your program. For this program, the header <iostream> is needed.

The line using namespace std; tells the compiler to use the std namespace. Namespaces are a relatively recent addition to C++.

The next line // main() is where program execution begins. is a single-line comment available in C++. Single-line comments begin with // and stop at the end of the line.

The line int main() is the main function where program execution begins.

The next line cout << "This is my first C++ program."; causes the message "This is my first C++ program" to be displayed on the screen.

The next line return 0; terminates main( )function and causes it to return the value 0 to the calling process.
