:
This is actual C++ compiler, which will be used to compile your source code into final executable program.

Most C++ compilers don't care what extension you give your source code, but if you don't specify otherwise, many will use .cpp by default

Most frequently used and free available compiler is GNU C/C++ compiler, otherwise you can have compilers either from HP or Solaris if you have respective Operating Systems.
