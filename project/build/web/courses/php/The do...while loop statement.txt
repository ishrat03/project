The do...while loop statement
The do...while statement will execute a block of code at least once - it then will repeat the loop as long as a condition is true.

Syntax
do {
   code to be executed;
}
while (condition);
Example
The following example will increment the value of i at least once, and it will continue incrementing the variable i as long as it has a value of less than 10 -

<html>
   <body>
   
      <?php
         $i = 0;
         $num = 0;
         
         do {
            $i++;
         }
         
         while( $i < 10 );
         echo ("Loop stopped at i = $i" );
      ?>
      
   </body>
</html>
This will produce the following result -

Loop stopped at i = 10
