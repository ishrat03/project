Braces make blocks
Although statements cannot be combined like expressions, you can always put a sequence of statements anywhere a statement can go by enclosing them in a set of curly braces.

Here both statements are equivalent -

if (3 == 2 + 1)
   print("Good - I haven't totally lost my mind.<br>");
   
if (3 == 2 + 1) {
   print("Good - I haven't totally");
   print("lost my mind.<br>");
}
