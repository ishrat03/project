Loops in PHP are used to execute the same block of code a specified number of times. PHP supports following four loop types.

for - loops through a block of code a specified number of times.

while - loops through a block of code if and as long as a specified condition is true.

do...while - loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop as long as a special condition is true.

foreach - loops through a block of code for each element in an array.

We will discuss about continue and break keywords used to control the loops execution.
