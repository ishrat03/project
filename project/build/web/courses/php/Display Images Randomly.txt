Display Images Randomly
The PHP rand() function is used to generate a random number.i This function can generate numbers with-in a given range. The random number generator should be seeded to prevent a regular pattern of numbers being generated. This is achieved using the srand() function that specifies the seed number as its argument.

Following example demonstrates how you can display different image each time out of four images -

<html>
   <body>
   
      <?php
         srand( microtime() * 1000000 );
         $num = rand( 1, 4 );
         
         switch( $num ) {
            case 1: $image_file = "/php/images/logo.png";
               break;
            
            case 2: $image_file = "/php/images/php.jpg";
               break;
            
            case 3: $image_file = "/php/images/logo.png";
               break;
            
            case 4: $image_file = "/php/images/php.jpg";
               break;
         }
         echo "Random Image : <img src=$image_file />";
      ?>
      
   </body>
</html>
It will produce the following result -
