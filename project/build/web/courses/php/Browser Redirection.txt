Browser Redirection
The PHP header() function supplies raw HTTP headers to the browser and can be used to redirect it to another location. The redirection script should be at the very top of the page to prevent any other part of the page from loading.

The target is specified by the Location: header as the argument to the header() function. After calling this function the exit() function can be used to halt parsing of rest of the code.

Following example demonstrates how you can redirect a browser request to another web page. Try out this example by putting the source code in test.php script.

<?php
   if( $_POST["location"] ) {
      $location = $_POST["location"];
      header( "Location:$location" );
      
      exit();
   }
?>
<html>
   <body>
   
      <p>Choose a site to visit :</p>
      
      <form action = "<?php $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] ?>" method ="POST">
         <select name = "location">.
         
            <option value = "http://www.tutorialspoint.com">
               Tutorialspoint.com
            </option>
         
            <option value = "http://www.google.com">
               Google Search Page
            </option>
         
         </select>
         <input type = "submit" />
      </form>
      
   </body>
</html>
