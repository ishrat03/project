The foreach loop statement
The foreach statement is used to loop through arrays. For each pass the value of the current array element is assigned to $value and the array pointer is moved by one and in the next pass next element will be processed.

Syntax
foreach (array as value) {
   code to be executed;
}
Example
Try out following example to list out the values of an array.

<html>
   <body>
   
      <?php
         $array = array( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
         
         foreach( $array as $value ) {
            echo "Value is $value <br />";
         }
      ?>
      
   </body>
</html>
This will produce the following result -

Value is 1
Value is 2
Value is 3
Value is 4
Value is 5
