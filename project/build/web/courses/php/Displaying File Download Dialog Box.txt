Displaying "File Download" Dialog Box
Sometime it is desired that you want to give option where a use will click a link and it will pop up a "File Download" box to the user in stead of displaying actual content. This is very easy and will be achieved through HTTP header.

The HTTP header will be different from the actual header where we send Content-Type as text/html\n\n. In this case content type will be application/octet-stream and actual file name will be concatenated along with it.

For example,if you want make a FileName file downloadable from a given link then its syntax will be as follows.

#!/usr/bin/perl

# HTTP Header
print "Content-Type:application/octet-stream; name=\"FileName\"\r\n";
print "Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"FileName\"\r\n\n";

# Actual File Content
open( FILE, "<FileName" );

while(read(FILE, $buffer, 100) ){
   print("$buffer");
}
