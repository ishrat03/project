Using the strlen() function
The strlen() function is used to find the length of a string.

Let's find the length of our string "Hello world!":

<?php
   echo strlen("Hello world!");
?>
This will produce the following result -

12
The length of a string is often used in loops or other functions, when it is important to know when the string ends. (i.e. in a loop, we would want to stop the loop after the last character in the string)
