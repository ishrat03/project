The String class includes a method for concatenating two strings -

string1.concat(string2);
This returns a new string that is string1 with string2 added to it at the end. You can also use the concat() method with string literals, as in -

"My name is ".concat("Zara");
Strings are more commonly concatenated with the + operator, as in -

"Hello," + " world" + "!"
which results in -

"Hello, world!"
Let us look at the following example -

Example
public class StringDemo {

   public static void main(String args[]) {
      String string1 = "saw I was ";
      System.out.println("Dot " + string1 + "Tod");
   }
}
This will produce the following result -

Output
Dot saw I was Tod
