Let us look at a simple code that will print the words Hello World.

Example
public class MyFirstJavaProgram {

   /* This is my first java program.
    * This will print 'Hello World' as the output
    */

   public static void main(String []args) {
      System.out.println("Hello World"); // prints Hello World
   }
}
Let's look at how to save the file, compile, and run the program. Please follow the subsequent steps -

Open notepad and add the code as above.

Save the file as: MyFirstJavaProgram.java.

Open a command prompt window and go to the directory where you saved the class. Assume it's C:\.

Type 'javac MyFirstJavaProgram.java' and press enter to compile your code. If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line (Assumption : The path variable is set).

Now, type ' java MyFirstJavaProgram ' to run your program.

You will be able to see ' Hello World ' printed on the window.

Output
C:\> javac MyFirstJavaProgram.java
C:\> java MyFirstJavaProgram 
Hello World
