Just as you can pass primitive type values to methods, you can also pass arrays to methods. For example, the following method displays the elements in an int array -

Example
public static void printArray(int[] array) {
   for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
      System.out.print(array[i] + " ");
   }
}
You can invoke it by passing an array. For example, the following statement invokes the printArray method to display 3, 1, 2, 6, 4, and 2 -

Example
printArray(new int[]{3, 1, 2, 6, 4, 2});
