A function declaration tells the compiler about a function name and how to call the function. The actual body of the function can be defined separately.

A function declaration has the following parts -

return_type function_name( parameter list );
For the above defined function max(), the function declaration is as follows -

int max(int num1, int num2);
Parameter names are not important in function declaration only their type is required, so the following is also a valid declaration -

int max(int, int);
Function declaration is required when you define a function in one source file and you call that function in another file. In such case, you should declare the function at the top of the file calling the function.
